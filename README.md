# ðŸš€ Econometrics Project: Do Training & Equipment Investments Drive Firm Profits?

Welcome to the repository for my **Applied Econometrics for Business** project at the **University of Limerick**. This project explores whether firms can increase profits through investments in employee training and capital equipment upgrades.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- **Data:** 962 firms from Manufacturing, Services, and ICT sectors  
- **Period:** Training & Equipment investments (2020â€“2023) vs. 2024 profits  
- **Model:** Multiple linear regression with robust standard errors  
- **Controls:** Firm size, innovation, R&D, export status, industry  
- **Comparisons:** Effects analyzed for small, medium, and large firms

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

The estimated model:

\[
\log(\text{Profits}_i) = \alpha + \beta_1 \log(\text{Training}_i) + \beta_2 \log(\text{Equipment}_i) + \beta X_i' + u_i
\]

where:

- \( \log(\text{Profits}_i) \): log of firm profits in 2024  
- \( \log(\text{Training}_i) \), \( \log(\text{Equipment}_i) \): log of cumulative investments (2020â€“2023)  
- \( X_i' \): controls (size, innovation, R&D, export, sector)  
- \( u_i \): error term  

Robust standard errors are used to handle heteroskedasticity.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- Equipment investment has a strong positive effect on profits, especially for medium and large firms.  
- Training investment positively impacts profits, more so for small firms and varies across sectors.  
- Innovation and R&D significantly boost profit outcomes, underscoring strategic investment importance.
